# Matlab Debugger for VS Code 

`MaDe`, Matlab Debugger for VS Code, is an Extension, which helps you to debug `matlab`-scripts in VS Code. 

The Software is early development, but already has some basic functionailities (see Features).   

## Features

Currently following features are implemented:

- Set and clear breakpoints in your `matlab`-script
- run your `matlab`-script step-wise or run your script onto the next breakpoint or end
- stack trace (only scriptwise rn)
- evaluate variables at runtime ()

## Next Steps

The next feature to come would be:
- improve the code and repo structe and add some explaination
- improve the debugging features
    - `step-in`
    - improve `stack trace` (e.g. functionswise `stack trace`)
    - `set variable`
- add testing

## Requirements

The extension was tested on `Ubuntu 22.04` with following package version:

- vscode 1.73.0
- npm 8.19.2

## Extension Settings

Currently there are no extension settings.

## Known Issues

TBA

Currently there is no (unit) testing. Since the one person project is at its start, issues are to be expected.

If you recieve any problems, feel free to open an issue.
