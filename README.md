# Matlab Debugger for VS Code 

`MaDe`, Matlab Debugger for VS Code, is an Extension, which helps you to debug `matlab`-scripts in VS Code. 

The Software is early development, but already has some basic functionailities (see Features).   

## Features

Currently following features are implemented:

- Set and clear breakpoints in your `matlab`-script
- run your `matlab`-script step-wise or run your script onto the next breakpoint or end
- stack trace (only scriptwise rn)
- evaluate variables at runtime ()

## Next Steps

The next feature to come would be:
- improve the code and repo structe and add some explaination
- improve the debugging features
    - `step-in`
    - improve `stack trace` (e.g. functionswise `stack trace`)
    - `set variable`
- add testing
